                <p></p>
                <p>Our sophisticated natural language system can pick up context in a conversation between you and the patient and automatically write your clinical notes for you.

                <p>Kiroku knows what is relevant and what is irrelevant. It can integrate seamlessly into your work flow, and we can have you up and running in 5 minutes</p>
                <p></p>
